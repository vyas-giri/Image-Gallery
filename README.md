IMAGE GALLERY

I used CREATE REACT APP workflow and integrated it with Tailwind CSS.

To generate images, I used PIXABAY API.

Searching for images can also be done in this. You can put any query, and you will get your result.

In case no results come up from the API I displayed "No results found".
